# ThreadedLockness
Lockless Data Type Research Project, the aim is to develop data types that are thread-safe absent a operating system level lock (critical section) and without using Monitor.Enter, or the lock statement. 


## Goals
* Thread Safe Linked List
* Thread Safe Dynamic Array
* Thread Safe HashSet
* Unit Tests for each class
